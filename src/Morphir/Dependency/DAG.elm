{-| This module implements a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) data structure with efficient topological ordering and cycle
detection capabilities. It's designed to be used in an incremental fashion. Adding an edge that forms a cycle will
immediately report an error. If there is no cycle the edge is inserted into the right level based on partial ordering.
This level can be used either to derive a topological ordering or to process in parallel as much as dependencies allow.
